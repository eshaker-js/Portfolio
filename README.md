# Jan Salama’s Portfolio 

**Live demo:** [www.jansalama.com](https://www.jansalama.com)

> Aspiring DevOps engineer, building **EchoShock**, an Indie Game Curation platform that aims to level the playing field by giving underrated indie games some spotlight! 
> I'm passionate about learning, improving, and leveraging my skills to solve real problems!

## Why I made this
This is a simple Next.js site where I toss up:
- My projects (some with live demos deployed with a CI/CD pipeline, including this repo itself)
- My certs (I didn't want to drown myself in an Msc full of stuff that didn't interest me, so I built my own syllabus to write meaningful code faster)
- Some life updates. (EchoShock, Events, Jobs.. anything really)

## Tech I use
- **Next.js + React + TypeScript**  
- **Tailwind CSS** (for speed)   
- **Docker + GitHub Actions + AWS EC2** 

## Local Run

If I ever have the site down for maintenance and anybody on the internet wants to see the latest version you can run it locally like this (I feel weird having this here, everybody knows how to do this but I guess it's an obligation haha)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jansalama/portfolio.git
cd portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
# visit http://localhost:3000 — boom
